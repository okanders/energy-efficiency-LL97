Data Organization:
    Much of my work thus far has been concerned in organizing my datasets. I have collected and appended 11 years of data (the PLUTO sets containing millions of points). I am dealing with many issues of dropping features and standardizing data types (away from object). I currently also have to revise the overall structure so that years 2010-2019 will be used for prediction purposes of a control group. I will then employ the Energy Use Intensity metrics from post Local Law 97 in 2019-2021 to contrast my predicted EUIs. 


ML Techniques:
    I have also outlined some of my OLS anf Ridge Implementation. I am waiting to fully have a refined dataset to work on and then should be able to apply the varying models. For optimization of my hypothesis class, I will compare accuracy on training data versus testing data.
